Overview:
Led a team research project focusing on password security vulnerabilities, user behavior analysis, and the development of a dynamic, user-centric password policy model. The project's primary objective was to address the increasing threats posed by sophisticated hacking techniques and to propose innovative solutions to strengthen password security mechanisms.

Key Contributions:
1. Research and Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of approximately 15 research papers to explore advancements in password security and hacking techniques. The study included a detailed literature review on the use of Machine Learning, AI, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) systems, biometric passwords, and password managers in enhancing security protocols.
   
2. Survey Implementation and Data Collection: Designed and executed a user survey titled "Uncovering Password Habits," gathering insights from 1,000 internet users. The survey focused on the evolution of password habits, challenges in password management, and user attitudes towards password security.

3. User Safety Score Development: Developed a novel metric called "User Safety Score" (ranging from 0.25 to 1) to assess individual password security risks based on user behavior and responses to key security questions. This metric helps tailor password policies by categorizing users into different risk profiles.

4. Policy Proposal and Simulation: Proposed a flexible password policy framework that adjusts based on the User Safety Score, promoting safer online environments especially for platforms involving monetary transactions. Simulated this policy to predict its effectiveness in reducing password-related vulnerabilities.

5. Case Studies and Real-world Applications: Analyzed recent high-profile data breaches, including those at Reddit and Sony, to understand and demonstrate real-world implications of password vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of existing security measures.

Results:
- Demonstrated potential reduction in password-related vulnerabilities through the new policy framework.
- Enhanced user trust and security awareness with the introduction of the User Safety Score.
- Provided actionable insights for organizations to adopt user-centered security measures.

Technologies Used: Data analysis tools, survey software, security simulation platforms.

Team Collaboration: Collaborated with a diverse team of 5, leveraging cross-disciplinary insights to enrich research and development outcomes.
